## Description

Google's BLS (Brand Lift Survey) is a measurement to measure the impact of online brand campaign with YouTube video ads.
About a day after seeing (or not seeing) the ad, a brief survey is delivered to both of the groups.
Google checks the impact of the campaigns on the brand on five levels:
* Ad Recall
* Brand Awareness
* Brand Interest
* Consideration
* Purchase Intent

Consolidating data across soures, crunching numbers and creating reports can be a tedious process.
No one likes doing the same things over and over again.

Thanks to this report automation tool, all you have to do is just type the unique campaign ID.
Being able to deliver a report to each client quickly is important and also automating the reports eliminates the manual errors that inevitably happen from time to time.
